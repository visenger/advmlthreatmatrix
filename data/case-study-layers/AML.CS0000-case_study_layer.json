[1], we built a model that was trained on a similar dataset as our production model and had performance similar to it.\nThen we crafted adversarial samples and queried the model and adjusted the adversarial sample accordingly till the model was evaded.\n", "techniques": [{"techniqueID": "AML.T0000", "showSubtechniques": true}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0000.001", "color": "#C8E6C9"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0002", "showSubtechniques": true}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0002.000", "color": "#C8E6C9"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0005", "color": "#C8E6C9"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0043", "showSubtechniques": true}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0043.003", "color": "#C8E6C9"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0042", "color": "#C8E6C9"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0015", "color": "#C8E6C9"}], "legendItems": [{"label": "ATLAS technique", "color": "#C8E6C9"}]}
